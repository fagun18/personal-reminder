# personal-reminder
A reminder is a simple application that can be used to set reminders and receive notifications at a specific time. Here's an example of a basic reminder application that you can use for personal use:

This code uses Python's built-in datetime and time modules to handle time and scheduling, and the os module to send a notification.

The code prompts the user to enter a reminder time in the format "HH:MM" and a reminder message. Then, it calculates the delay time, in seconds, until the reminder time and sets a reminder using the reminder function. The function uses the time.sleep() method to wait for the specified delay time before sending a notification using the os.system() method, which is a command-line interface to interact with the system.

This is just a simple example and can be customized and extended as per the requirement, The reminder can be made more interactive using GUI libraries like Tkinter, PyQt etc.

Please note that the above code snippet uses the notify-send command which is a linux command, If you are using windows then you should use a different command or library to send notifications.
